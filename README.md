# CISC474DeathCalcApp
## Running the APP (cloud9 instructions)
- You have to run the API on a different server than the webapp, which can be done following the steps below.

### Create 2 workspaces.
#### In the first Workspace:
- go into the folder API_MARK2 and run mongod. 
- run app.js from API_MARK2
- you may have to do multiple installs. 
- npm install express, npm install body-parser, npm install mongoose, npm install mongodb should take care of everything

#### In the second Workspace:
- go into folder Web_App. 
- in js/death.js, set the API url to whatever your URL is from above.
- run Web_App/index.html

## About our APP
We found a database of Deaths in the United States on Kaggle.com. We used a machine learning algorithm written by one of our group members in order to be able to tell you with your age, education level, gender, and month of death, what is statistically the most probable way you would die. There are 7 possible answers including Suicide, Homicide, Accident, Natural, Under Investigation, Unknown, and Not Specified. 

We wrote a data manipulation app, which simply changes the data into medium that can be parsed using the machine learning. for example, combining multiple fields that track the same thing, turning words into numbers (e.g., male ->0, female->1)

The machine learning algorithm we used uses information gain and entropy algorithms to build a decision tree. This tree can answer question posed to it, even if the original data did not have the specific case. 

We saved this decision tree in a mongodb. Each node is represented as an entry, and it also includes whether the node is a goal node, the goal category, split category if it is not a goal, splitvalue, and left and right children.

When we get a query, we go to the first node of the tree. if the node is not a goal, we check the split category. we then Compare the value of that category in the request with the splitvalue. If the value of the request is lower than the splitvalue, we go to the left child. If the value is greater, we go to the right child. We continue to do this until we hit a goal, when we return the goalcategory. We return this as a JSON object, which is then written to the screen by the WebApp.
